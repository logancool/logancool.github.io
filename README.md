Welcome. This is my personal gh-pages hosted site repository. This code is intentionally un-tested, messy and incomplete. The goal of this site is to host a lightweight-free insight into who I am. That being said, if you find something interesting or block that could be improved on feel free to comment. 

Thanks.

Note: `dev` is being treated like `master` since gh-pages doesn't allow changing branches under org accounts.
